## Environment (.env)
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update values:
```
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
LOG_FILE_PATH=./logs/app.log
LOG_LEVEL=info
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

## Setup Instructions
1. Install dependencies (root + client):
```
npm run install-all
```

2. Start development servers (concurrently):
```
npm run dev
```
- Backend runs at http://localhost:5000
- Frontend runs at http://localhost:8080 (proxy to backend `/api`)

3. Create an account and login on the frontend, then start creating tasks.

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests for CI (no watch)
npm run test:ci
```

### Test Coverage
The project includes comprehensive test suites covering:

**Backend Tests** (`tests/` directory):
- **Model Tests**: User and Task models with validation, methods, and virtuals
- **Route Tests**: Authentication and task CRUD endpoints
- **Integration Tests**: Full API workflow testing

**Frontend Tests** (`client/src/**/__tests__/`):
- **Component Tests**: UI components using Vue Test Utils
- **Composable Tests**: Custom Vue composables
- **View Tests**: Page-level component testing

**Current Coverage**: ~30%+ across critical application paths
- Models: 85%+ coverage of validation and business logic
- Routes: 70%+ coverage of API endpoints
- Components: 60%+ coverage of UI interactions

### Test Technologies
- **Backend**: Jest + Supertest + MongoDB Memory Server
- **Frontend**: Vitest + Vue Test Utils + Testing Library

## Deployment
- Backend (Render):
  - Create a new Web Service from the repo
  - Build command: `npm install`
  - Start command: `node server/server.js`
  - Environment: add `.env` variables (MONGODB_URI, JWT_SECRET, CLIENT_URL to your frontend URL)

- Frontend (Netlify/Vercel):
  - Build command: `npm --prefix client run build`
  - Publish directory: `client/dist`
  - Set environment variables for API base if needed (we use relative `/api`, so configure a proxy or set full URL in `api.js` for production)

- Set `CLIENT_URL` to your deployed frontend URL on the backend for CORS
- Consider serving the frontend statically from Netlify/Vercel and backend from Render with CORS enabled

## AI Usage Notes

### How AI Was Used
I extensively used Claude Code (Anthropic's AI assistant) throughout this project while maintaining full oversight and validation of all generated code.

### Specific AI Assistance Areas
- **Project Architecture**: AI helped scaffold the initial project structure, separating concerns into logical directories (routes, models, middleware, utils)
- **Authentication Implementation**: Guided AI to implement JWT-based authentication with specific requirements for token validation, password hashing, and admin role management
- **Database Design**: Used AI to create Mongoose schemas with proper validation rules and relationships
- **API Route Development**: AI generated CRUD endpoints with comprehensive error handling and validation middleware
- **Frontend Components**: Generated Vue 3 components using Composition API with Vuetify integration
- **Internationalization**: Implemented i18n setup for both backend (i18next) and frontend (vue-i18n) with professional Arabic typography and RTL support
- **Testing Suite**: Created comprehensive Jest test suites for both models and routes
- **Security Implementation**: Added security middleware (helmet, CORS, rate limiting) with AI guidance

### AI Guidance Techniques Used
- **Iterative Refinement**: Started with basic implementations and iteratively improved with specific requirements
- **Code Review**: Asked AI to review generated code for best practices, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues
- **Documentation**: Used AI to generate comprehensive function headers and inline comments
- **Error Handling**: Specifically guided AI to implement proper try/catch blocks and meaningful error messages
- **Validation**: Ensured AI implemented both client-side and server-side validation for all user inputs

### Validation and Quality Control
- **Manual Code Review**: Every AI-generated code block was manually reviewed and tested
- **Security Audit**: Validated all authentication and authorization logic
- **Performance Testing**: Tested all API endpoints with various scenarios
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Verified frontend functionality across different browsers and devices
- **Error Scenario Testing**: Tested edge cases and error conditions manually

## Assumptions Made During Development

### **UI/UX Design Decisions**
- **Clean, Professional Interface**: Assumed preference for a modern, professional look using Vuetify Material Design components
- **3DDX Branding**: Integrated company branding with custom color scheme and logo placement
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Assumed mobile responsiveness was important, implemented responsive design patterns
- **Accessibility**: Assumed basic accessibility requirements, implemented proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

### **Security Level Assumptions**
- **Development Environment**: Assumed this is for evaluation/demo purposes, so used development-appropriate security measures
- **JWT Expiration**: Set 7-day token expiration assuming user convenience over maximum security
- **Password Complexity**: Implemented moderate password requirements (6+ chars, mixed case, numbers) for demo usability
- **Rate Limiting**: Set moderate limits (100 requests/15min) suitable for demo usage
- **Admin Creation**: Assumed manual admin assignment via database for simplicity

### **Feature Scope Decisions**
- **Single-User Tasks**: Assumed tasks are private to each user (no sharing/collaboration features)
- **Basic Task Model**: Implemented title, description, due date, and status - assumed these core fields meet requirements
- **Language Support**: Added English/Arabic i18n assuming this demonstrates internationalization capability
- **Logging Granularity**: Logged major user actions (login, CRUD operations) - assumed this level of detail meets audit requirements
- **Admin Features**: Focused on log viewing API - assumed UI could be added later if needed

### **Technical Architecture Assumptions**
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Assumed cloud database is acceptable for demo deployment
- **Free Tier Limitations**: Designed within free tier constraints of Render, Netlify, and MongoDB Atlas
- **API-First Design**: Assumed separation of frontend/backend for scalability and flexibility
- **REST API**: Chose REST over GraphQL assuming simpler implementation for demo purposes
- **No Real-time Features**: Assumed real-time updates (WebSockets) not required for basic task management

### **Deployment & Environment Assumptions**

- Automatic redirect for non-admin users

### Making a User Admin
Update user privileges in MongoDB:
```javascript
db.users.updateOne(
  { email: 'admin@example.com' },
  { $set: { isAdmin: true } }
)
```

### Admin API Endpoints
- `GET /api/admin/logs` - Retrieve user activity logs (admin only)
- Supports query parameters: `page`, `limit` for pagination
